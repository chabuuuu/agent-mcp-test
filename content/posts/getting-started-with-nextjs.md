# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables functionality like server-side rendering, static site generation, API routes, and more without requiring complex configuration.

## Why Choose Next.js?

Next.js provides an excellent developer experience with all the features needed for production:

- **Hybrid Static & Server Rendering**: Pre-render pages at build time (SSG) or request time (SSR).
- **Fast Refresh**: Instant feedback during development.
- **Route Pre-fetching**: Makes your application feel fast and responsive.
- **Built-in CSS Support**: Supports CSS Modules, Sass, and other styling options.
- **API Routes**: Build API endpoints easily without separate backend setup.

## Creating a New Project

Getting started with Next.js is straightforward. Run the following command to create a new project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```

This will set up a new Next.js project with all the necessary configuration.

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project has the following structure:

```
my-next-app/
  ├── .next/
  ├── node_modules/
  ├── public/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── app/
  │   │   ├── page.tsx
  │   │   ├── layout.tsx
  │   │   └── globals.css
  │   ├── components/
  │   └── pages/ (for Pages Router)
  ├── .gitignore
  ├── next.config.js
  ├── package.json
  ├── README.md
  └── tsconfig.json
```

## Basic Routing

Next.js has a file-system based router built on the concept of pages.

With the newer App Router:
- Files named `page.tsx` become routes
- Folders define the route structure
- Special files like `layout.tsx` and `loading.tsx` provide shared UI

## Conclusion

Next.js simplifies React development by providing built-in features that would otherwise require complex configuration. It's an excellent choice for projects of any size, from simple static sites to complex applications.

In future posts, we'll explore more advanced features of Next.js and how to leverage them for your projects.
